#Preliminary Work â€“ Getting Started

# I have chosen the data from the Kaggle.com on the English Education of the population in a certain region. 
# As required the data set has 1105 rows that is within the limit of  and 31 attributes approved by the professor. 

#3-4 Questions to analyse the data are -
#Q1 - Comparison of Job Density, Income, Population and Education. 
#Q2 - Which town name has the most education stats of student population?
#Q3 - What is the population on the town name with lowest education level?

## Part 1 = Exploring
# Question 1 - Review the data set - Please refer to slide deck, slide 1

#Question 2 - Cleaning the data set 
#Importing the data frame in the R Script
